### Data Structure Research 

In this repo, I would like to use different (programming ) languages to realize different data structures, especially advanced data structure. 

#### 2-3 tree 

[2-3 tree](tree23.hh) is a variety of balanced tree, which applies the bottom-up build style. 

In this version of realization, some limitations are acceptable: 
- C++ language support: c++11 
- Info passes using try - catch (if you'd like c++17, variant is second choice. ) 
- Class security: the class life time supports! 
- (TODO) Exception safe 

### Test Bench 

*please be noted that, this part is still on planed.* 

In this part, an efficiency testing is still important.
